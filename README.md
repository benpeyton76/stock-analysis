Overview of Project

Virtual Basic Applications was the subject of module #2. The scope of the lesson was to learn basic core coding fundamentals, apply them to complex solutions for sorting data, and even some cell formatting. I found this module to be very challenging at first but found that repetition was key to understanding the syntax of Visual Basic. Plenty of mistakes had to be made in order to understand the process. By no means am I an expert, but I did enjoy the challenge.

Results

I did not get the complete results that are required for this challenge. I was able to, however, to get the script to run. The issue I keep having in my code is that no matter what year I write in the button, it only sends results from 2018. Although I did not get to analyze both worksheets side by side, I was able to conceptualize the idea behind this lesson. Using conditionals to write out functions allows the author to set parameters and fine tune data sorting. By refactoring the original script, the loop times get shorter because there is not as much code for the computer to sort through. Much like recycling, the code repeats itself through different variables until the end of the loop.

Summary

The biggest advantage of refactoring code efficiency. By looping code, it saves time instead of writing code for every variable separately. Refactoring also increases the efficiency of time taken for the computer to process the loop and can be easier to debug. Disadvantages of refactoring it can not improve underlying code building issues. This can be an issue when the programming language becomes dated. Another disadvantage to refactoring code is that it can potentially introduce bugs that take time to find and fix.
